# SBA-4: Task Management App
**Author:** Jameka Haggins 

In this assessment, you will build a Task Management App that allows users to add tasks with deadlines, assign categories, and update the status of each task. This app will require you to apply a wide range of JavaScript concepts, including arrays, objects, DOM manipulation, conditionals, and local storage to persist the task data.

The challenges that I faced was: understanding the eventlistener and how it's used within the code. How to make arrays and loops, and also taking a crack at local storage. 

Group coding really helped me with understanding what was challenging to me, and how to correctly approach it. I want the computer to do x, now I have to speak in it's language in order to communicate corectly. It was difficult because I tried to apprach it all at once, but what helped was breaking each task down, and before I knew it I had lines upon lines of code.

If given more time, I would figure out how to change the display of the date. Currently it's yy:mm:dd , I need it in American: dd:mm:yy
